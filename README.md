# Fieri

The Fieri service has become a part of a complete Supermarket system - the code has been moved into the [Supermarket code base](http://github.com/chef/supermarket).

This cookbook should no longer be used for configuring Fieri, you should now configure it through whatever cookbook you use to configure Supermarket.

This repo is deprecated and will no longer be accepting issues or pull-requests.
